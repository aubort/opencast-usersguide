# Welcome to Opencast
Opencast is a free, open-source software designed to support the management of audio and video content in educational, corporate and medical settings. Opencast is a set of highly configurable media services that most adopters use to produce recordings, manage existing video, serve designated distribution channels, and provide user interfaces to engage learners with video. Opencast includes the following features:

* Administrative tools for scheduling automated single and multi-stream recordings, manually uploading files, and managing metadata, and processing functions

* Video editing enables users to trim or edit video prior to publishing

* Integration with a variety of commercial and open-source recording devices in the classroom for capture. For up-to-date information, please visit the [Commercial Service Provider page](http://opencast.org/matterhorn/vendors) on the Opencast homepage.

* Processing and encoding services that prepare and package the media files with trailers, bumpers, cover slides, and watermarks.

* Distribution to local streaming and download servers and configuration capability for distribution to channels such as YouTube, iTunes or a campus course or learning management systems (LMS) like Sakai, Moodle and others.

* HTML5 multi-stream media player for learners to engage with content, including slide preview, content based search.

The Opencast community is a collaboration of individuals, higher education institutions, corporations and integrators working together to explore, develop, define and document best practices and technologies for management of audiovisual content in a multitude of settings.
