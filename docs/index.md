# Welcome to Opencast

Opencast is a free, open-source software designed to support the management of audio and video content in educational, corporate and medical environments. Most adopters of Matterhorn use Opencast to produce recordings, manage existing video, serve designated distribution channels, and provide user interfaces to engage learners with video.

## About this Documentation

This documentation is written for users who will primarily access and use Opencast through the administrative user interfaces. If you are interested in technical documentation on how to install, extend, or integrate Matterhorn these documents will work best:

## Browser Support

The administrative user interfaces have been tested and known to work in the latest versions of Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. This does not mean it will not work in other browsers, it just hasn’t been tested. Feel free to test and provide your feedback.
