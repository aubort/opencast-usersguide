# Overview
The Users page is accessible from the **Main Menu > Users/Groups > Access Policies**. This page lists all Access Policies that are present in the Opencast installation.
Access Policies allow to create default permissions list (aka. ACL). These Policies can be applied to Series and Events.

>It is currently not possible to manage Access Policies in the new UI. Please refer to the previous version of the UI to manage Access Policies.
