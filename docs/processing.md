# Overview
Processing Tasks can be started on Events that have successfully been added to the Opencast asset management (i.e. they are not in processing, scheduled or failed state).

A Task is essentially applying a workflow on an Event. A Task can be started on one or multiple events by **selecting the Event(s) > Actions > Schedule Task**. Select the workflow and press Submit to start the Task.

>It is currently not possible to stop a running Task.
