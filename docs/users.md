# Overview
The Users page is accessible from the **Main Menu > Users/Groups > Users**. This page lists all users that are present on the installation.

>Opencast supports various types of user directories which means that the users listed on this page may come from various sources. Depending on which directory a user is stored in, its details may or may not be editable (see “How to edit users”).

## How to add Users
Users can be added by using the **Add user** button. Make sure all the mandatory information is filled. Users can be assigned a Role upon creation or edit. To set the user’s role using groups, see the [Groups section](groups.md).

## How to edit Users
Use the edit icon (☰) on the Actions column to edit a user.


## How to delete Users
Use the delete icon (⨂) in the Actions column to delete users.


>Some users are not manageable because they are defined in a read-only directory and cannot be edited via the UI.
